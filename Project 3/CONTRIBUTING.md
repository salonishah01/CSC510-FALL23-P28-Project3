Let's squash those bugs together! Follow this guide to submit a bug report that helps us understand and fix the issue promptly.

### How to Submit a Bug Report?

Bugs are like ninjas—we need to spot them! Here's how you can help us:
* Craft a clear and catchy title for the issue.
* Walk us through the steps to recreate the bug with all the juicy details. Tell us about your OS, Python version, and any environment configurations.
* Show us examples—links, snippets, anything that paints the picture.
* Describe the observed behavior and what's bugging you about it.
* Envision the ideal behavior and tell us why it's essential.
* If it's a performance or memory hiccup, spill the details on any encountered errors.

### Before You Hit Submit
