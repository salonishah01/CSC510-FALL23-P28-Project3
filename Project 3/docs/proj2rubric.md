|-|-----|---------|
|.5| short release cycles|We had multiple releases, as well tested different components iteratively|
|.5| workload is spread over the whole team (so one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others...| Despite the commit count difference, workload was spread evenly|
|.5|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing | Yes, animations, videos, motivation etc.|
|.5|the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up  |Guidelines in contributing.md |
|.5|Docs: doco generated , format not ugly  | in GH|
|.5|evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people) | Same package, server and config files updated by everyone. |
|.5|evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base |[Contributors](https://github.com/Urvashi74/slash/graphs/contributors)  |
|1|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation)  | In Codebase|
|.5|Number of commits: by different people  | [Pulse](https://github.com/Urvashi74/slash/pulse)|

|.5|Use of code formatters. | config files in GH showing your this formatter's config|
|.5|Use of style checkers | config files in GH showing your config|
|.5|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code. | [Readme.md](https://github.com/Urvashi74/slash/blob/main/README.md) |
