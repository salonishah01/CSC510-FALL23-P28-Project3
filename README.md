## :rocket: Installation

## 1. Python Virtual Environment Setup (Windows)
We need the Python 3.9 version; hence, we need to setup a virtual environment (venv). Following are the steps to setup venv:

```
Install python 3.9 #installing python
py --list #to view all versions on python present
py -3.9 -m venv {virtual environment name} creating a virtual environment
cd {virtual environment name} #navigating to virtual environment
Scripts\activate #activating virtual environment
```

## 2. Python Virtual Environment Setup (Mac OS)
1. We need the Python 3.9 version. Follow the below steps for setup: 1) Install Homebrew:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Now install PyEnv to switch between different version of python

```
brew install pyenv
```

3. Now, to install the required version of Python using PyEnv, run this command:

```
pyenv install 3.9.2
```

4. To set up the MacOS path for pyEnv in ZSH or OhMyZSH

```
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init --path)"\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.zshrc
pyenv global 3.9.2
pyenv versions
```

## 3. Clone the Repository
1. Clone the Github repository to a desired location on your computer. You will need [git](https://git-scm.com/) to be preinstalled on your machine. Once the repository is cloned, you will then `cd` into the local repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/salonishah01/CSC510-FALL23-P28-Project3.git
cd CSC510-FALL23-P28-Project3
```

2. All the Python requirements of the project are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Use pip to install all of those.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Node Setup for Front-end
1. For the frontend setup, ensure that [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is preinstalled. 

```
Install node 18.17.1 by installing older version of node.js
```

2. All the node requirements are listed in the `client/package.json` file. Use npm to install all of those.

```
cd client
npm install
```
If you are facing an error,

```
ERROR: upstream dependency conflict
```

To resolve this, the below command is executed

```
npm install --force
```

You may also encounter this issue:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'NotRequired' from 'typing_extensions'
```

To resolve that, we have to execute:

```
pip install typing_extensions==4.7.1 -upgrade
```

## 5. Run the Application
1. After installing all the prerequisites, navigate to the `src` directory using the `cd` command. Once you are inside the `src` directory, execute the Python command to launch the `main.py` file.

```
cd src

For Mac
python3 main.py

For Windows
python main.py
```

2. Once the backend is up and running, you will have to `cd` into the `client` folder. Once in the `client` folder, use the node command to start the webserver.

```
cd client
npm run start
```
